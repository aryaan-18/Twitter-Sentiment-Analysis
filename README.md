# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Logistic Regression and RoBERTa LLM

This repository contains the implementation of a sentiment analysis project on Twitter data, utilizing both Logistic Regression and RoBERTa (a state-of-the-art language model). The project explores the effectiveness of traditional machine learning versus deep learning approaches in accurately classifying tweet sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. This analysis was conducted as part of a Natural Language Processing (NLP) course mini-project.
